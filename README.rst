``gptables`` is an opinionated python package for spreadsheet production.
It produces ``.xlsx`` files from your ``pandas`` dataframes or using
``reticulate`` in R. You define the mapping from your data to elements of the
table. It does the rest.

``gptables`` uses the official `guidance on good practice spreadsheets`_.
It advocates a strong adherence to the guidance by restricting the range of operations possible.
The default theme ``gptheme`` should accommodate most use cases.
However, the ``Theme`` object allows development of custom themes, where other formatting is required.

``gptables`` is developed and maintained by the `Analysis Function`_. It can be
installed from `PyPI`_ or `GitHub`_. The source code is maintained on GitHub.
Users may also be interested in `a11ytables`_, an R native equivalent to
``gptables``, and `csvcubed`_, a package for turning data and metadata into
machine-readable CSV-W files.

5 Simple Steps
--------------

1. You map your data to the elements of a ``GPTable``.

2. You can define the format of each element with a custom ``Theme``, or simply use the default - gptheme.

3. Optionally design a ``Cover`` page to provide information that relates to all of the tables in your Workbook.

4. Optionally upload a ``notes_table`` with information about any notes.

5. You ``write_workbook`` to win.
