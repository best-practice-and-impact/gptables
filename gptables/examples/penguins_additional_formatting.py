"""
Penguins - Additional Formatting Example
------------------------------------

This example demonstrates additional formatting that is not supported in
the ``gptable.Theme``.

Specific columns, rows and cells of the table elements (indexes, column headings and data)
can be formatted using the ``gptable.GPTable(..., additional_formatting = ...)`` parameter.
This parameter takes a list of dictionaries, allowing you to select as many rows, columns
or cells as you like.

As with all formatting, supported arguments are desribed in the
`XlsxWriter documentation <https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/format.html#format-methods-and-format-properties>`_.

Any formatting not possible through this means can be achieved using
``XlsxWriter`` `Workbook <https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/workbook.html>`_
and `Worksheet <https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/worksheet.html>`_ functionality.
A ``gptable.GPWorkbook`` object is returned when using the
``gptables.produce_workbook`` API function.
The ``GPWorkbook.worksheets()`` function returns a list of ``GPWorksheet`` objects,
which can also be modified.
