Penguins - Notes Example
----------------------

This example demonstrates how to include notes in a GPTable. Notes cannot 
be included in data cells but may appear either in column headers or in text such 
as titles, subtitles, etc.

Placeholders for notes are put in using the notation, $$note$$. The actual note text 
must be provided as a Pandas dataframe to the notes_table argument of the ``gptables.write_workbook`` function.
This dataframe should contain the text of the placeholder, the actual text you want in the note and (optionally)
any hyperlinks you want in the note.

## Define table elements
