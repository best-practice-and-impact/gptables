Unreleased
===================


Released (PyPI)
===============

v1.0.0
------
:Date: 2022-06-04

**Added** 

* contents page added to workbook by default. Can be disabled or customised by supplying ``contentsheet_label`` and ``contentsheet_options`` parameters to ``produce_workbook`` or ``write_workbook``.
* notes page added to workbook if ``notes_table`` is provided. Can be customised by supplying ``notesheet_label`` and ``notesheet_options`` parameters to ``produce_workbook`` or ``write_workbook``.
* ``table_name`` property added to ``GPTable`` class. This must be provided for accessibility.
* ``instructions`` property added to ``GPTable`` class. If this is not provided, a default value will be used.
* validation for ``GPTable.table`` column names - all columns must be named and the names must be unique
* ``instructions_format`` added to ``Theme``
* links formatted using the markdown format of ``"[display text](link)"`` will be rendered with the display text showing and the link applying for the corresponding cell. Links must start with ``http://``, ``https://``, ``ftp://``, ``mailto::``, ``internal:`` or ``external:``
* ``GPTable.table`` will be marked up as a worksheet table in Excel
* example added to demonstrate the use of a custom theme YAML

**Changed**

* ``auto_width`` property of ``produce_workbook`` and ``write_workbook`` now defaults to ``True`` rather than ``False``
* ``scope`` property of ``GPTable`` is now optional, as this information may be included in title or subtitles
* ``source`` property of ``GPTable`` is now optional, as this information should be included in cover sheet if it is the same across sheets
* ``units`` property of ``GPTable`` is now optional, and should be provided as ``dict`` (``str`` no longer supported)
* ``legend`` property as ``GPTable`` is now optional
* ``footer_order`` property of ``Theme`` replaced by ``description_order``, as corresponding metadata have been moved from below to above table. Valid elements are now ``instructions``, ``source``, ``legend`` and ``scope``.
* notes are now numbered according to position in workbook, starting from cell A1 of the first data sheet. Previously, notes were ordered independently for each worksheet
* ``units`` are now written on a new line with the the corresponding column heading cell, instead of above the table
* examples updated to reflect new functionality
* default theme changed to be more accessible, inparticular, font sizes increased to at least 12pt and font colour set to automatic. Note: compatibility issues with LibreOffice and automatic font colour

**Removed**

* ``notes`` and ``annotations`` properties removed from ``GPTable`` class. Notes are no longer displayed on data worksheets
* ``include_index_column_headings`` property removed from ``GPTable`` class, index column headers now always written, for accessibility
* ``quick_and_dirty`` function removed, as it is inaccessible and does not demonstrate good practice
* ``disable_footer_parentheses`` removed, as footer is inaccessible and parenetheses not good practice
* ``additional_elements`` property removed from ``Cover`` class. This is because table of contents is now generated on contentsheet not cover.
* ``annotations_format`` and ``notes_format`` options removed from ``Theme``, as ``annotations`` and ``notes`` no longer written to data worksheets
* ``missing_value`` option removed from ``Theme``. Unavailable or white-space table entries are now written as blank cells, and the user is invited to consider the GSS guidance on symbols and shorthand in spreadsheets

**Fixed**

* incorrect version numbers in changelog
* minor typos in docs
