Accessibility checklist
***********************

The tables below indicate your accessibility responsibilities when publishing
statistics in spreadsheets. It is based on the Analysis Function `checklist of
the basics`_ and heavily inspired by the `a11ytables documentation`_.

.. _`checklist of the basics`: https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-spreadsheets-accessible-a-brief-checklist-of-the-basics/
.. _`a11ytables documentation`: https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/articles/checklist.html

.. note:: The tables show which checklist items are automatically met by
    gptables. This applies to workbooks created using the default ``gptheme``
    and may not apply if custom themes or additional formatting are used.

    * - Run a spelling and grammar check
      - Essential
      - Not implemented

        responsibility.
    * - Use the accessibility checker
      - Desirable
      - Not implemented
      - gptables does not have a built-in accessibility checker. Whilst all

        responsibility sits with the user.

      - Essential
      - Not implemented
      - gptables does not add title or language information to the document,
        this responsibility sits with the user. Note: the document properties
        available depend on the user's operating system and may not meet
        the standard required for webpages.
    * - Ensure the cursor is in cell A1 of the first worksheet when doing your final save
      - Essential
      - Implemented
      - Workbooks written using gptables will have the cursor in the first cell.
        Note: if the workbook is subsequently opened and saved, it is the user's
        responsibility to check that the cursor has not been moved.
